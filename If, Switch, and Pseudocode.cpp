//Prompt the customer to input their customized art piece information, and then calculate and display an invoice from that data

/*
Create a symbolic constant PI - 3.1416
Build and display a menu for the user that displays the three choices of shapes available with an option to also quit the program
Prompt the customer to enter a desired art shape via a menu option.
    Display an error message if input is invalid
Prompt the customer to enter their name
Prompt the customer to input the dimensions of the shape they have chosen
Calculate the volume of the desired shape
    Use setprecision to calculate to the tenth of a decimal point
    a. Volume of a cube: side3
    b. Volume of a torus: (1/4) (PI)^2 (r + R) (R - r)^2
    c. Volume of an ellipsoid: (4/3) (PI) (a) (b) (c)
Calculate the handling fee and shipping charge based on the volume fo the shape
    Volume (x cubic feet)   Handling fee        Shipping Charge based on Volume
    0 < x <= 50              $5.55              $0.10 per cubic foot
    50 < x <= 100            $7.75              $0.23 for each cubic foot > 50
    100 < x <= 150           $9.50              $0.28 for each cubic foot > 100
    x > 150 $11.25 $0.32 for each cubic foot > 150
Calculate the total processing charge (sum of handling and shipping)
Create an invoice
    Display the name of the customer
    Display the name fo the chosen art shape
    Display the dimension(s) of the shape
    Display the calculated volume
    Display the handling fee
    Display the shipping charge
    Display the total pocessing charges
